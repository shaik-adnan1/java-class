# Time Complexity

## Three notations for Complexities.

## BIG O vs BIG Ω vs BIG Θ

### BIG O (O) - Worst case.

- O(1) - Constant - Execution time does not depend on the input size.
- O(n) - Loop over an array of n Items - Time grows linearly with input size.
- O(n2) - Nested Loop (a loop inside another) -
- O(log n) - Divide input in half each time (binary)
- O(n log n) - Loop + Divide input in half each time

### How to determine Time Complexity

```
- 1. Look at the number of operations.

- 2. Conver the operations into expressions.

```

## For Space -

- O(1) - Constant - Extra Space.
- O(n) - Loop over an array of n Items - Time grows linearly with input size.
- O(n2) - Nested Loop (a loop inside another) -
-

### BIG Omega (Ω) - Best case.

### BIG Theta (Θ) - Average case.

## Time (How fast it runs)

# Space Complexity

## Space (How much space/memory it use)
